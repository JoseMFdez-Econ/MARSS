   abstract = {1. The temporal variability of many animal populations increases with the length of census period. This pattern is associated with the reddened spectral colour, quantified by the spectral exponent, which is typically around + 1. 2. We used simulation models to explore the effects of various population-level processes on the spectral colour of the simulated time series of abundances. 3. Our results showed that the observed spectral exponents could be explained as the effect of a combination of measurement error and natural variability (in the form of white environmental noise). 4. Thus, it may not be necessary to invoke complex varieties of environmental noise to explain the observed spectral exponents.},

   abstract = {The risk of population extinction in stochastic models due to demographic variation is reviewed in some basic population models. Theoretical results pertaining to the probability of population extinction and expected time to extinction in discrete and continuous-time Markov chain models are presented along with some numerical examples illustrating these results. We begin with the simplest type of stochastic population model, the exponential growth model, then discuss the logistic growth model, a model with an Allee effect, and a spatially implicit metapopulation model. All of these stochastic models are continuous in time, but the state space is discrete. It is shown that similar methods of analysis apply to all of these models. In addition, some nonlinear structured models are considered. These models are formulated as branching processes, discrete-time Markov chain models. The extinction dynamics for all of these models are compared.

   volume = {205},

   abstract = {The Hawaiiangreenseaturtle genetic stock is endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. This stock was depleted over the past century mainly due to over-exploitation that ceased during the 1970s following protection under the US Endangered Species Act. Nesting trends suggest the stock has been recovering but no formal stock assessment has been undertaken. So, we used a Bayesianstate-space surplus-production model to describe Hawaiiangreenturtle population dynamics given limited data and uncertainty about seaturtle demography. Data series comprised commercial landings of greenturtles reported from the Archipelago (1944–1973) and nester abundance recorded at the primary rookery on East Island, French Frigate Shoals (1973–2004). The model incorporated process and observation error and was fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with a mix of informative and non-informative priors. We estimated that the Hawaiiangreenturtlestock was ca. 20% of pre-exploitation biomass when monitoring and protection began in the 1970s. The stock is estimated to be now ca. 83% of pre-exploitation biomass with an intrinsic growth rate ca. 5.4% pa (95% Bayesian credible interval: 3.1–8.9%). Rebound or recoverypotential (also exploitation rate at MSP) of this stock was estimated to be 3.4% (1.6–6.2%), which is consistent with estimates for other long-lived late-maturing marine species. So, this once-seriously-depleted greenturtlestock is well on the way to recovery and a limited harvest might now be demographically feasible. These findings are relevant for supporting informed public policy debate on the restoration of indigenous hunting rights in the Archipelago. Parameter estimates and model structure from the Bayesian surplus-production model were incorporated in an interactive easy-to-use stochastic simulation model to help support policy analysts in stockrecovery planning and to explore sustainable harvestpotential.},

In particular, we note th at although catastrophes are likely to have precipitated many extinctions, estimates of the probability of catastrophes are unreliable.},

   abstract = {We evaluate a method for fitting models to time series of population abundances
that incorporates both process noise and observation error in a likelihood framework.
The method follows the probability logic of the Kalman filter, but whereas the Kalman
filter applies to linear, Gaussian systems, we implement the full probability calculations
numerically so that any nonlinear, non-Gaussian model can be used. We refer to the method
as the ‘‘numerically integrated state-space (NISS) method’’ and compare it to two common
methods used to analyze nonlinear time series in ecology: least squares with only process
noise (LSPN) and least squares with only observation error (LSOE). We compare all three
methods by fitting Beverton-Holt and Ricker models to many replicate model-generated
time series of length 20 with several parameter choices. For the Ricker model we chose
parameters for which the deterministic part of the model produces a stable equilibrium, a
two-cycle, or a four-cycle. For each set of parameters we used three process-noise and
observation-error scenarios: large standard deviation (0.2) for both, and large for one but
small (0.05) for the other. The NISS method had lower estimator bias and variance than
the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with
stable-equilibrium parameters, in which case the LSPN and LSOE methods has lower bias
when noise variances most closely met their assumptions. For the Beverton-Holt model,
the NISS method was much less biased and more precise than the other methods.
We also evaluated the utility of each method for model selection by fitting simulated
data to both models and using information criteria for selection. The NISS and LSOE
methods showed a strong bias toward selecting the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt, even
when data were generated with the Beverton-Holt. It remains unclear whether the LSPN
method is generally superior for model selection or has fortuitously better biases in this
particular case. These results suggest that information criteria are best used with caution
for nonlinear population models with short time series. Finally we evaluated the convergence of likelihood ratios to theoretical asymptotic
distributions. Agreement with asymptotic distributions was very good for stable-point Ricker
parameters, less accurate for two-cycle and four-cycle Ricker parameters, and least
accurate for the Beverton-Holt model. The numerically integrated state-space method has
a number of advantages over least squares methods and offers a useful tool for connecting
models and data and ecology.},

   journal = {Ecological Monographs},
   volume = {71},
   number = {2},
   pages = {277-303},
   abstract = {A defining hypothesis of theoretical ecology during the past century has been that population fluctuations might largely be explained by relatively low-dimensional, nonlinear ecological interactions, provided such interactions could be correctly identified and modeled. The realization in recent decades that such nonlinear interactions might result in chaos and other exotic dynamic behaviors has been exciting but tantalizing, in that attributing the fluctuations of a particular real population to the complex dynamics of a particular mathematical model has proved to be an elusive goal. We experimentally tested a model-predicted sequence of transitions (bifurcations) in the dynamic behavior of a population from stable equilibria to quasiperiodic and periodic cycles to chaos to three-cycles using cultures of the flour beetle Tribolium. The predictions arose from a system of difference equations (the LPA model) describing the nonlinear life-stage interactions, predominantly cannibalism. We built a stochastic version of the model incorporating demographic variability and obtained conditional least-squares estimates for the model parameters. We generated 2000 "bootstrapped data sets" with a time-series bootstrap technique, and for each set we reestimated the model parameters. The resulting 2000 bootstrapped parameter vectors were used to obtain confidence intervals for the model parameters and estimated distributions of the Liapunov exponents for the deterministic portion (the skeleton) of the model as well as fur the full stochastic model. Frequency distributions of estimated dynamic behaviors of the skeleton at each experimental treatment were produced. For one treatment, over 83% of the bootstrapped parameter estimates corresponded to chaotic attractors, and the remainder of the estimates yielded high-period cycles. The low-dimensional skeleton accounted for at least 90% of the variability in the population abundances and accurately described the responses of populations to experimental demographic manipulations, including treatments for which the predicted dynamic behavior was chaos. Demographic stochasticity described the remaining noise quite well. We conclude that the fluctuations of experimental hour battle populations are explained largely by known nonlinear forces involving cannibalistic-stage interactions. Claims of dynamic behavior such as periodic cycles or chaos must be accompanied by a consideration of the reliability of the estimated parameters and a realization that the population fluctuations are a blend of deterministic forces and stochastic events.},

   abstract = {Census data on endangered species are often sparse, error-ridden, and confined to only a segment of the population. Estimating trends and extinction risks using this type of data presents numerous difficulties. In particular, the estimate of the variation in year-to-year transitions in population size (the "process error" caused by stochasticity in survivorship and fecundities) is confounded by the addition of high sampling error variation. In addition, the year-to-year variability in the segment of the population that is sampled may be quite different from the population variability that one is trying to estimate. The combined effect of severe sampling error and age- or stage-specific counts leads to severe biases in estimates of population-level parameters. I present an estimation method that circumvents the problem of age- or stage-specific counts and is markedly robust to severe sampling error. This method allows the estimation of environmental variation and population trends for extinction-risk analyses using corrupted census counts-a common type of data for endangered species that has hitherto been relatively unusable for these analyses.},

   abstract = {Census data on endangered species are often plagued by problems that make quantitative population viability analysis (PVA) a challenge. This paper addresses four such problems: sampling error, density dependence, nonstable age structure, and population supplementation that masks the true population status. Estimating trends and extinction risks using such corrupted data presents serious parameter estimation difficulties. Here I review diffusion approximation (DA) methods for estimating population status and risks from time series data. A variety of parameterization methods are available for DA models; some correct for data corruption and others do not. I illustrate how stochastic Leslie matrix models can be used to evaluate the performance of a proposed DA model and to select among different DA parameterization methods for a given application. Presenting the uncertainty in estimated risks is critical, especially when the data are highly corrupted and estimated parameters are more uncertain. Using a Bayesian approach, I demonstrate how the level of data support for different risk levels can be calculated using DA parameter likelihood functions.},

   abstract = {Diffusion approximation (DA) methods provide a powerful tool for population viability analysis (PVA) using simple time series of population counts. The e methods have a strong theoretical foundation based on stochastic age-structured models, but their application to data with high sampling error or age-structure cycles has been problematic. Recently, a new method was developed for estimating DA parameters from highly corrupted time series. We conducted an extensive cross-validation of this new method using 189 long-term time series of salmon counts with very high sampling error and nonstable age-structure fluctuations. Parameters were estimated from one segment of a time series, and a subsequent segment was used to evaluate the predictions regarding the risk of crossing population thresholds. We also tested the theoretical distributions of the estimated parameters. The distribution of parameter estimates is an essential aspect of a PVA because it-allows one to calculate confidence levels for risk metrics. This study is the first data-based cross-validation of these theoretical distributions. Our cross-validation analyses found that, when parameterization methods designed for corrupted data sets are used, DA predictions are very robust even for problematic data. Estimates of the probability of crossing population thresholds were unbiased, and the estimated parameters closely followed the expected theoretical distributions.},

   abstract = {Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment, often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR( 1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

   abstract = {We introduce a new statistical computing method, called data cloning, to calculate maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors for complex ecological models. Although the method uses the Bayesian framework and exploits the computational simplicity of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it provides valid frequentist inferences such as the maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors. The inferences are completely invariant to the choice of the prior distributions and therefore avoid the inherent subjectivity of the Bayesian approach. The data cloning method is easily implemented using standard MCMC software. Data cloning is particularly useful for analysing ecological situations in which hierarchical statistical models, such as state-space models and mixed effects models, are appropriate. We illustrate the method by fitting two nonlinear population dynamics models to data in the presence of process and observation noise.},

   abstract = {Time series of population abundance estimates often are the only data available for evaluating the prospects for persistence of a species of concern. With such data, it is possible to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) with diffusion approximation methods using estimates of the mean population trend and the variance of the trend, the so-called process variation. Sampling error in the data, however, may bias estimators of process variation derived by simple methods. We develop a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based method for estimating trend, process variation, and sampling error from a single time series based on a discrete-time model of density-independent growth coupled with a model of the sampling process. Transformation of the data yields a conventional linear mixed model, in which the variance components are functions of the process variation and sampling error. Simulation results show essentially unbiased estimators of trend, process variation, and sampling error over a range of process variation/sampling error combinations. Example data analyses are provided for the Whooping Crane (Grus americana), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus), and Puerto Rican Parrot (Amazona vittata). This REML-based method is useful for PVA methods that depend on accurate estimation of process variation from time-series data.},
